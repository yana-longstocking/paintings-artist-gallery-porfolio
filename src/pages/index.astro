  artistBioText: `Born and raised in Ukraine, I began drawing at an early age and have
    continued to develop my practice ever since. While my degree is in
    architecture, I am a self-taught artist specializing in highly
    detailed pencil drawings. My work focuses primarily on female
    characters, exploring themes of identity, aspiration, and the pursuit
    of ideal beauty. Often marked by slightly exaggerated proportions, my
    drawings balance elegance with subtle elements of the grotesque,
    creating a distinct visual language. Since relocating to Madrid in
    2022, I have continued to expand my practice, producing intricate and
    precise works that reflect both personal expression and technical
    discipline.`,
